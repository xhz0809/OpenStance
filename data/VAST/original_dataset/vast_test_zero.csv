Steve Austin,"The liberals' contributions to this section are basically saying that two Articles and four Amendments will fix what two Articles and three Amendments haven't. Yet, the states do a good job of running elections and the required IDs are easy to get, in a process already overseen by our heavily politicized DOJ. Regarding the extravagant demand for transportation, both major parties have local people who drive you to get IDs or to vote already. We should keep that effort in the private sector where it arose. If you are frantic enough not to trust the judicial system already, one more amendment won't cure what ails you. What would help all of us is more knowledge of history - which we won't find on the Soros blogs. Force people to vote? When all they are interested in is celebrity and sports buzz or their iPhones, absolutely not.

Tigermoose,"I agree with Dr. Bauerlein. I am but one case study of what is probably a larger trend. I graduated with my B. S. in Computer Information Systems. But what I was really enthused about was literature and writing. So I took two years off from work to go into a Masters program in English. My enthusiasm turned to repugnance when I realized that succeeding in the humanities was more about politics and high theory than a passion and a dedication to teach literature. Now I am back to working in information technology. Universities were once the gateways to information and learning. With the internet and our vast open information resources, we no longer have to pay outrageous tuition costs in order to get access to those resources and commentary on those resources.

tominny,"I hate bike lanes because they slow me down and inhibit my flow with the traffic. And pedestrians wander into bikes lanes because they think they are not part of the road. Happens to me all the time. Some walker without even looking just ambles off the sidewalk, his back to me, right in front of my path. Also when traffic turns through a bike lane this involves extra lights and a real cluster mix situation for everyone. And don't get me started about trucks parking in cycle lanes to unload - all the time. And lastly, the worst is car drivers get to shout ""get in the bike lane"" now when I""m going around a truck or something.

Too many places where, well you can get there, but you have to jump off the train and ride the bus.

Fewer mass transit users means it is easier to cut mass transit funding etc. Low income residents, the disabled and the elderly rely heavily on mass transit. Bicycling benefits young people. Cycling is great in low density European cities with low-rise buildings - but not in high-density NYC with one high-rise after another.

Chatham H Forbes Sr,"Professor Nussbaum speaks a vital truth. We have a constant push for more science and mathematics, more technology majors. The assumption is that we are losing the international sweepstakes if we don't excel other nations in these fields. We want to make the Faustian bargain, in which we choose to gain the whole world, technical ascendancy, by forfeiting our soul, the humanities. The error here, as Professor Nussbaum says, is in assuming that the two areas of study are unrelated and separable, which they are not. The best American universities recognize that they are graduating multi-dimensional human beings. Nothing could be more destructive of our civilization than to graduate one-dimensional specialists. Today's political campaign, with its capture by extremist reactionaries of gullible voters undereducated for citizenship, demonstrates that we have an acute need for multi-dimensional education throughout our society.

The studies to which you refer examine calorie restriction diets, which do not work because they induce a starvation-like state that leads to metabolic changes.

Graham Anderson,"""From beginning to end, I believe the Bible is the infallible word of God and I accept it in whole, not in part. As such, I believe the Bible is clear that homosexuality is a sin."" Is it clear? The ancient Israelites inherited a law that homosexual acts (particularly outside of a straight marriage) were sinful, but the rest of the Bible is silent on gay and lesbian people in committed relationships, or possibly it even hints at approval in the story of David and Jonathan. Anti-gay theology is a clear case of the very slicing and dicing that ultra-conservatives claim to abhor. Anyway, a people who accepted the whole Bible would have a lot of child-murder to do. Clearly even ultra-conservative Christians don't take the ancient laws at face value.

Michael Hogan,"The day before the massacre I received a cartoon by e-mail from a conservative friend - yes, I lean liberal, but I have many good friends who are quite conservative - that very explicitly managed simultaneously to smear Muslims - ALL Muslims - as being anti-gay while at the same time smearing liberals - ALL liberals - as treating Christian conservatives differently from Muslims when it comes to being anti-gay and implying that we do so out of some misguided sense of political correctness.

Carl Z.,"Perhaps rather than forcing greek societies - private organizations controlled individually by charters mandating single-sex admittance - to change their policies, perhaps universities could instead change rules that force fraternities to be the center of social life on campus. Allowing sororities to host parties, for instance, would put women in charge of the distribution of alcohol, which in turn could help to curtail instances of alcohol-related sexual assault. Campuses forcing greek life to go co-ed will lead only to the national chapters of these organizations to suspend their charters at the school.

Richard Strimbeck,"Don't limit people access, limit vehicle access. When I first visited YNP in 1973, the eastern third of the valley was closed to cars and serviced only by the propane powered buses. I remember riding on the roof of the bus in total awe, cruising along quiet roads, getting off at Happy Isles and heading off to Vernal Falls. On a recent summer visits in 2011 and 2014, those same roads have become linear parking lots, with rangers and summer employees working as high-paid parking lot attendants.

Carol,"Governor Jerry Brown has made it clear in his State of the State message that he wants HSR. He ordered the new, more realistic study. legislators recently proposed merging CAHSR with Caltrans for better management; and starting at both ends rather than the central valley. This way they can improve existing infrastructure beginning this year with stimulus $$ already allocated. SF is already building the train station. LA needs trains. Much less effect of earthquakes the deeper you go underground. Peninsula cities need to stop the NIMBYism and plan for tunnels to mitigate the disruption of elevated Berms. replace dangerous-street-level-loud Caltrains with pedestrian/bicycle greenway over the tunnels. BART was impossibly expensive too, but the longer we waited the more the price grew. A new freeway is more expensive. $200/trip for 30 years doesn't sound so bad compared to all the jobs and development around train stations.

Michael,"The scarcity argument is so tiresome. We remain the wealthiest country in the world. There is no scarcity of funds; there's a lack of willingness to spend those funds on things like education. The elephant in the room here is college sports programs. (I can't believe none of the contributors to this debate even mentioned it!) Universities with elite athletic programs--and their numbers are great--are FLUSH with cash, much of it provided by taxpayers, private donors (usually alumni), and corporate donors (the latter two also being taxpayers with choices about how their incomes are spent). Meanwhile, the academic departments go begging, almost literally, for scraps.

A more proper question for the state of New York is ""should SUNY Albany be preserved?"". Seriously. SUNY suffers more than 60 campuses. The elimination of the humanities at one of the larger SUNY locations is a wake up call. It is time to consolidate the sprawling SUNY system so that the surviving campuses can operate competently.

Christina,As an addiction medicine physician I think it would be worthwhile to force treatment on addicts if their use is a danger to self and others. I have worked all over the country and one state that allows this already is South Carolina. I can sign papers as a doctor and mandate treatment. Treatment for substance abuse is effective if it's voluntary and also if its involuntary. Sometimes patients left to make their own decision will not make the right one and will not do on their own so it's a way of getting the thousands of people who really need treatment to treatment. In most cases it's not a moral hazard for a hospital . Hospitals may file papers for force substance abuse treatment but quite often the individual would go to another facility elsewhere. Because there is an drug epidemic and that opiate overdose is the leading cause of death over motor vehicle accidents in young people in this country something must be done .

THM,"I share these concerns but I believe that the problem lies in a misalignment of the 9 justices with the body politic, and that this is the result of 30- and 40-year tenures of modern justices. The solution is term limits for justices. Every president should nominate 1 justice in each of the 1st and 3rd years of his or her term, save only when either a justice has retired or died during that period (and the sitting president has made a nomination) or when the turnover has been so great that no justice has served less than 15 years. The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years. It would also mean that the justices would be more cautious about taking radically new directions (like destroying the voting rights act and campaign finance regulation) in view of any majority they assemble to rewrite the law inevitably dissolving in much less than a generation.

J. Cornelio,"I think it was Churchill who said that democracy is the second worst form of government devised by man. What's the worst? Everything else. Our democracy suffers from some serious dysfunctions as the writer notes but I'd be hesitant to entrust nine (actually 5) unelected, usually pretty disconnected jurists in black robes the power to ... well, keep expanding their power. Whether you consider any particular ruling open-minded or open-hearted or reactionary or downright evil or righteous, history is strewn with the corpses of societies which fail to improve their democracy and, instead, turn to a select cabal to make critically important decisions.

I also see those who struggle to get coherent thoughts on a page. Guess what? Those who write well tend to be the more successful business leaders. The message the SATs should send is to tell students that the ability to construct a coherent and supported paragraph or short essay is critical to business success.

Doug Giebel,"Some have questioned whether a gun-carrying woman with a gun pressed against her head would have prevailed had she drawn her weapon. We don't know, but it seems doubtful. Many college students love parties, binge drinking and the problems (including anger, fights and sexual abuse) created by those situations. College students also face emotional problems that do or can lead to suicide, and a gun is the easy exit choice -- as it was many years ago when a college freshman friend of mine took his life. Troubled high school and college students are frequently in the news for causing mayhem and carnage on campus. Generally those so inclinded use surprise as a strategy.

Southern Boy,"Milliennials burdened by college debt? They chose to take out that debt. Nobody forced them to do that. They made a choice to go into serious debt and now they must accept it and figure out how to deal with it. That's part of the growing up thing. Before they selected a college to attend, they should have sat down with their parents and determined which college was most affordable for them, not which college would be the grooviest to attend. Most of the issues facing the millennials result from the choices they have made over the course of their lives. Too bad they don't have truly serious issues facing them, like the possibility of being drafted and sent off to fight America's overseas wars. There's an example of somebody else making a choice for you that you have absolutely no choice in the matter, other than defying the law, going to prison (like Muhammad Ali), or leaving the country.

Katherine Cagle,"No, don't abolish tenure, just make it more effective by giving tenure only after 4 or 5 years. Teach principals how to deal with ineffective teachers -- how to document, step up observations and evaluations, how to dismiss teachers who are not effective. The problem is that most principals don't know the difference between good and bad teachers. In my 36 years working in schools I observed that the principal usually praised the teachers who most often agreed with and flattered them. Yes, teachers usually do stay in the same job, maybe not in the same location, and it's a good thing if they do. I worked in 5 different schools over my career and the most effective schools had a good mixture of experienced and new teachers. The experienced teachers helped new teachers with discipline and techniques they had learned over the years. The new teachers added new ideas and new theories of education. Combined, they all made for an excellent school culture.

Unfortunately, the intellectual challenges presented to research workers in most of these areas are rather minimal. Often current applied research is based on well-understood topics in pure physics and mathematics. It's dull research for minimally-trained scientists. The main benefit to such applied fields is that the intellectual distance between the faculty and the students is narrowing. The other benefit is in grants, contracts, and patents that the military-industrial-pharmaceutical complex makes possible. Thus the faculty now trains little cogs for the benefit of the Empire. The loss of French departments and other humanities departments is just part of the reorganized modern university, which is an instrument of the modern nation state to attain greater wealth and power for some and a stultifying life for most.

C Wolfe,"I'm dismayed at the number of comments that miss the point, which is that we need to preserve the integrity of our intellectual tradition. Piecemeal budget cuts are a bad thing. This is not a battle between science and the humanities; it's a battle FOR a flourishing intellectual ecosystem, which is so complex as evolved that, as with the natural ecosystem, we shouldn't be driving niches into extinction. There is no enmity between the sciences and the humanities. They are richly complementary. Anecdote: For some reason, when I was an undergraduate classics major, some of the most well-rounded, thinking students I knew were geology majors. Why geology? Not sure. Maybe because it was West Virginia, where mineral wealth had long been exploited by out-of-state corporations. These geology maors, who were preparing themselves with the scientific understanding to deal with mineral managements, were also intellectually engaged in a most vivid way with their classics and philosophy classes.

Robert Dee,"So the plan is simply to hand an 85-year old senior citizen a cash payment and put the onus on them to decide if a procedure or test their doctor tells them they need is a good idea or not; when they're short on food and rent, and are trying to save money.

Nicolas,"The author's opinion of public transit in Los Angeles and San Francisco / Oakland / San Jos? is dated. Both metro areas have good public transit, and getting better. Even if LA's is not currently much used by upper middle class riders, these are not the only people we care about. Moreover, he is badly mistaken when he says that a high-speed rail service ""doesn't touch the huge mass of traffic, which swirls daily in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas."" Intercity rail and local transit are mutually supportive. Predictably, if high speed trains arrive in downtown LA, more people will use the red, gold and other rail lines to reach their trains than currently do to get to LAX. On the contrary, shifting intercity travel preferences has great potential, especially over time, to shift local travel preferences.

Nicolas,"The author's opinion of public transit in Los Angeles and San Francisco / Oakland / San Jos? is dated. Both metro areas have good public transit, and getting better. Even if LA's is not currently much used by upper middle class riders, these are not the only people we care about. Moreover, he is badly mistaken when he says that a high-speed rail service ""doesn't touch the huge mass of traffic, which swirls daily in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas."" Intercity rail and local transit are mutually supportive. Predictably, if high speed trains arrive in downtown LA, more people will use the red, gold and other rail lines to reach their trains than currently do to get to LAX.

PT,"The only thing that makes bikes in the city absolutely maddening is the fact that bike riders do not obey traffic rules. They just plain don't. Every time I hit the streets on foot I have to dodge a cyclist who is ignoring a red light, riding the wrong way on a one-way street, riding on the sidewalk, making a turn on a red light and on and on.

billcole,"While I was getting my doctorate at Harvard, I wrote two articles saying basically the same thing Prof Bauerlein says here. In both cases readers attacked me as reactionary (Tea Partiers would likely call me a Communist) and argued for the importance of abstruse theory.

I remember one faculty member at Harvard proudly justifying the decision to give tenure to a woefully underqualified professor of Spanish literature on the grounds that the department ""needed"" an openly gay professor who could teach about things like gay pride and gay rage.

Alex,"I see a trend here.

Turkey has left their 50 year old history of secularism and gone back to their 1000 year history of radical islam to re-establish the Ottoman Empire. 2.

oh,"Russia having a common interest in cooperating on terror seems like a valid point. But a minor one, when compared with Russia's larger geopolitical objectives. I believe Russia's hidden motive in Syria, is to use the immigration crisis as a weapon to attack the west. Russia is using the west's own sense of compassion and valuation of human rights, as a weapon against us. By continuing a endless civil war and emptying out the country of Syria, forcing migration to Europe (since most people apparently prefer the personal liberty available in democratic societies, as opposed to either poor and/or authoritarian countries like Russia & China), Russia can create a continuing burden of crisis proportions, and a distraction from the world's ability to coordinate a response to counter Russian expansionism in Crimea, Syria, the middle east, the arctic, and elsewhere.

md,"I can't understand why the justification for the study of Humanities is utilitarian in most of the pieces and blogs in this article. Certainly critical thinking skills can be obtained in the social and natural sciences (often to a greater degree than in languages) and ditto for the other general skills it supposedly provides (but not necessarily). The point is that Humanities constitutes windows to many areas of human thinking and accomplishment in the past and present--and that in itself is sufficient justification. The arguments put forth by Humanists in this piece are not very compelling (if that is a sign of the skills the discipline trains them for).

Steve,"Dr. DuPont and the three other debaters conveniently overlook an important part of the current epidemic of prescription opioid abuse: we really know very little about it. As a physician who specializes in pain management I can tell you that we don't know how many people who are abusing and becoming addicted to these drugs obtained them illicitly, how many lied to physicians to obtain them, and how many received them for legitimate pain complaints. If we coerce this last group into getting treatment for the substance abuse, who's going to do something about their pain? Also benzodiazepine abuse and addiction is a major problem and we know that these are mostly a result of physicians prescribing these without giving much thought to the abuse potential.

Luckily, we attended school in the 1960s-'70s and it was quite affordable.

Yes, higher education should be at least affordable to all and actively encouraged. We need an educated populace to compete in the world economy, obtain good jobs and ensure a functioning democracy.

As a student of French I have had an enormous exposure to the cultural and political issues that dominate North African, West African, and Carribean peoples. Moreover, I have been fortunate enough to gain an understanding of the American immigration debate through the comparative study of Chicano/Chicana literature juxtaposed with the literature of North African immigrants in France.

Ian,"Ms Oreskes is "" professor of the history of science and an affiliated professor of earth and planetary sciences at Harvard University"". In other words she is not a scientist but an historian and her background is in geology NOT in physics. Perhaps this helps to explain why her article is so wrongheaded. Fukushima was NOT a major disaster and was NOT due to seismic problems but the Tsunami. So yes, don't situate nuclear plants on the coast but that does not rule out inland West Coast sites.

It is fairly obvious that their is a certain limit to which resources would be strained. But the focus is totally off. Poverty causes population growth, not the other way around.

chispa7890,"The key advantage for 3D printing will be mass customization -- not mass production. There will undoubtedly be vast improvements in the feedstock materials for the printers. And there will be applications in which traditional manufacturing processes will be better. But 3D printing will allow for customer choice on a scale not now possible. Take the example of a kitchen. We now build the shelving around the refrigerator, stove and dishwasher. Why not build a refrigerator to the dimensions and heights that work for me and the room? The printer can build the shelves that go around the unit as well.

Lorenzo,"Brazil's political and economic problems are no reason to postpone or cancel the games. While the non-political ideal of the Games has never actually existed, canceling the games at this late stage would only make things more political. And as for conditions on the ground, most of the (very real) damage that Dr. Williamson points out has already been done. The Zika virus is another story. It's too early to confidently predict the course of the epidemic.

DG,"#12 elizabeth: Right on about the continued importance of French! French is spoken as a native or near-native language by something like 200 million people (most of whom are not French). If you add a few hundred million more non-native speakers and consider the global distribution of places where French is important to commerce and politics, it is obviously one of the most widely spoken and influential languages in the world - and the numbers are growing, not falling. French-speaking Africa is experiencing some of the highest rates of population growth in the world, and incidentally contains a large chunk of the world's untapped supplies of oil, uranium, and other natural resources. Meanwhile, France is the only major European power whose population is actually growing, and is on track to become Western Europe's most populous country in just a few decades; so the future of French as a pan-European language also looks bright. So yes, French is a heavy hitter as global languages go. In some parts of the world, it is indispensable for diplomacy and business.

So while locked to parking signs or mailboxes in reletively short order 2 bikes were destroyed while locked up and finally after an accident with another biker which landed me in the emergency room I gave up the experiment.

N.G. Krishnan,"This write up is enlightening and sensible, dispeling some popular misconception about the breath taking 3D printing technological revolution. Economic growth requires innovation, enabled through this kind of technologies. Innovation is an integral part of prosperity of an organization which cannot occur without embracing state of the art capabilities. One important capability of 3D printing, is to enable continuous innovations. Yet, as aptly pointed out by the author, traditional manufacturing still holds an important place in the business world. Once products are developed, it is challenging for 3D printers to match the economies of scale available through traditional manufacturing. The main advantage of 3D printing is enabling of low cost rapid prototypes , as compared to traditional manufacturing, which typically requires higher volumes to lower costs. 3D printing will potentially have a greater impact on the world over the next 20 years than all of the innovations from the industrial revolution combined. There can little argument that every industry must be fast, flexible and capable to understand the implications that 3D printing will have on their businesses. Failure will mean disaster.

B.,"Look, I've been riding my bike in Brooklyn for over half a century -- and on Cape Cod. The bike lane on Prospect Park West is an eyesore. Look back from the old Sanders Theater towards Grand Army Plaza -- you'll see that the cars parked in what used to be the third lane throw off the straight line running to the monument.

Sue,Surely people need to see the cycle of events here. People need jobs to pay the taxes to cover the cost of education to get the jobs......round and round we go.

Pyramider,"Nuclear energy can be a safe and clean source of power if we replace the current light-water and heavy-water reactor designs with thorium-cycle reactors. But that will only happen with a groundswell of political opposition to the standard designs and awareness of the differences between types of nuclear reactors.

achilles13,For my generation NATO was mainly about defending Western Europe against the feared encroachment of the then Soviet Union. Following the second world war Germany was weak and divided. NATO's real mission ended with the reunification of Germany and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since those events NATO has been an organization in search of a purpose. It keeps getting dragged in to questionable areas like Afghanistan and middle eastern civil wars such as happened in Libya.

According to this view, the sole point of learning a foreign language is to be able to conduct business dealings in that language.

This attitude of course misses innumerable advantages of learning a foreign language, and shokcinlgy enough, even a dead language like Latin. Reading directly in another language without the filter of translation, engaging with another culture and another mode of seeing and thinking about the world, and learning how to express oneself in another tongue - all of these things have no meaning to the utilitarians and the philistines. I suppose if everyone else just spoke English we could dispense with all this nonsense about foreign languages.

Dee,"I agree that not everyone needs French, and frankly not everyone desires to learn French. There should be a supply/demand system to which language classes to offer at a certain school. Growing up, the only choice we had was Spanish in all our public schools. Why? In a border state, it was the most useful. French is not a very useful language in the US, unless you plan on working abroad or in Canada. I don't condone removing languages entirely from education (learning any language is a useful skill), but in order to make the most of a person's time and his/her desire to learn a certain language, then offer what has the highest demand, probably these days Spanish and Mandarin, the two most spoken languages globally ahead of English.

Carl Z.,"Perhaps rather than forcing greek societies - private organizations controlled individually by charters mandating single-sex admittance - to change their policies, perhaps universities could instead change rules that force fraternities to be the center of social life on campus.

Christina,As an addiction medicine physician I think it would be worthwhile to force treatment on addicts if their use is a danger to self and others. I have worked all over the country and one state that allows this already is South Carolina. I can sign papers as a doctor and mandate treatment. Treatment for substance abuse is effective if it's voluntary and also if its involuntary. Sometimes patients left to make their own decision will not make the right one and will not do on their own so it's a way of getting the thousands of people who really need treatment to treatment. In most cases it's not a moral hazard for a hospital . Hospitals may file papers for force substance abuse treatment but quite often the individual would go to another facility elsewhere. Because there is an drug epidemic and that opiate overdose is the leading cause of death over motor vehicle accidents in young people in this country something must be done .

THM,"I share these concerns but I believe that the problem lies in a misalignment of the 9 justices with the body politic, and that this is the result of 30- and 40-year tenures of modern justices. The solution is term limits for justices. Every president should nominate 1 justice in each of the 1st and 3rd years of his or her term, save only when either a justice has retired or died during that period (and the sitting president has made a nomination) or when the turnover has been so great that no justice has served less than 15 years. The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years. It would also mean that the justices would be more cautious about taking radically new directions (like destroying the voting rights act and campaign finance regulation) in view of any majority they assemble to rewrite the law inevitably dissolving in much less than a generation.

Daydreamer,"Obese people live difficult lives to be sure, but pointing the finger at genetics or saying they are discriminated against is simply avoiding the ugly truth. They are addicts - plain and simple. Obesity is no more a disability than someone with a drug problem. You say genetics are to blame?

In the end, they may not be personally to blame, in full, but when it comes to drugs, you can fire the abuser instantly without repercussions. Obese people are of the same ilk, except that their drug of choice is food. All the nonsense about slowed metabolisms due to defective thyroids is nothing more than smoke in mirrors.

The bike is clearly superior in that it respects the environment creating no air or noise pollution.To revert back to a bike lane free city is to go back into the dark ages of this city. The paradigm must change.Drivers need to realize that one person on a bike is just as important as one person in a car.They are just two people trying to get where they are going..one quietly and the other creating a swath of noise and filth behind them.

Andy Behrman,"I think this sets a precedent for young people we do not want to go to. With the legalization of doping products we are telling our kids that it's okay to use enhancement drugs? So in high schools we will allow our athletes to use steroids? This is the message we want to send to our children?

Casual Observer,"Making teachers more vulnerable to termination is bound to cause them to begin to actually try to teach. Everyone knows that teachers are slackers who are too lazy to find real jobs and receive taxpayer money for jobs which they systematically fail to perform. How many teachers actually work before their first classes and after the end of their last classes? The end to all of that, now. It's one thing to complain about real problems with significant effects upon what affects the K-12 educations, it's quite another make up problems which don't. Tenure can be adjusted to require some greater experience and qualifications but eliminating it just makes teaching a far less desirable occupation.

Eric,"Everytime Hanushek mentions research, watch out. The research he manages to find always seems to reinforce his preferred narrative, no matter how little it resembles reality. Back in reality, tenure is basically a rule that allows the firing of bad teachers while prohibiting the firing of good ones.

I know my point of view is unusual, in a society where voting is regarded as a kind of party - the more the better. But perhaps this is an area where skill matters. If most voters had graduated from college, I doubt that we would see Cain or Perry as viable candidates. We complain that they are appealing to ignorant voters, and at the same time we insist that more of the ignorant vote. This is foolish.

Jeff,"I particularly enjoyed the comment that said we shouldn't study foreign languages, because we have to compete in a global economy.

BG Graham,"Wrong, America does not have serious voter turnout problems. Democrats have serious voter turnout problems. Of course they would support mandating that people ignorant of the issues vote. That's their voting base. And the entire reason for the election and re-election of President Obama. First of all, a society that claims to be free CANNOT force people to vote. It irrevocably ceases to be free as soon as you require people to do things they don't have any interest in doing. Second, forced participation for the sake of participation is an idea that could only originate with and be supported by a group of politicians who know that preying on the poor, ignorant, and easily manipulated is their best chance to hold onto power forever. Simply force them to vote and then lie constantly to demonize the opposition, and you ALWAYS win!

Nicolas,"The author's opinion of public transit in Los Angeles and San Francisco / Oakland / San Jos? is dated. Both metro areas have good public transit, and getting better. Even if LA's is not currently much used by upper middle class riders, these are not the only people we care about. Moreover, he is badly mistaken when he says that a high-speed rail service ""doesn't touch the huge mass of traffic, which swirls daily in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas."" Intercity rail and local transit are mutually supportive. Predictably, if high speed trains arrive in downtown LA, more people will use the red, gold and other rail lines to reach their trains than currently do to get to LAX.

xxx,"The SAT essay has been made optional so that college doors remain open that would otherwise be closed to the non-literate majority emerging from today's secondary schools. We need only consider the letters written home by the relatively uneducated soldiers of the Civil War, the power of which only a minuscule percentage of today's high school graduates (not to mention so very many in college) could hope to equal. Writing skills are acquired, first of all, through READING ( a lot!) the works of those who write well; and then, through WRITING (a lot!). Neither is possible to any significant degree of success in our public education system, because existing class size would require teachers to devote every single evening until midnight, and then the entire weekend, to reviewing and evaluating their students' writing assignments.

Adam,"I'm a native New Yorker who, in years past, never would have biked in the city because of fear for my safety. However, because of the new bike lanes, I now feel safe enough to bike around my neighborhood in Brooklyn. This summer, I bought a bike for the first time.
