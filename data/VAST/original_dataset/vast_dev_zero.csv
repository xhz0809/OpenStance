Dstaszak,"Look, there are issues to be debateed. Do we need as much brick and mortaror public shelf space as we have? I use libraries a lot.

Kate,"Several years ago when I was working with a Christian NGO in a largely Muslim area of Northern Kenya I asked a female colleague why she covered her head completely in the same way as Muslim women. She was surprised at my question and responded that it was a sign that she was a mature married woman.

I later watched an interview with a young woman barber in Indonesia, where most Muslims are highly tolerant of other faiths (five are officially recognized by the government) and virtually all Muslim women wear the local style of hijab. When she was asked how she reconciled her profession with Muslim restrictions on contact with men, she replied in a matter of fact way that if she followed this rule she wouldn't be able to work and support her small daughter, and that wouldn't be good for anyone.

Charles Michener,"I've been a national critic of film, music, photography, books and cultural issues in general. I've always preferred the term ""writer about . . ."" to ""critic"" or ""reviewer"" (as in ""writer about movies or ""writer about dance""). A cultural subject - a live performance, a book, a painting, a film - is simply a complex occasion for writing well about something. A piece of ""criticism"" is worthwhile not because of its particular opinion, but because it is entertaining, provocative, and illuminating not just of the particular work but of the work's place in a larger historical, artistic and social context. Ultimately, any ""critic"" stands or falls on self-revelation: the subject under scrutiny is as much his or her particular prejudices, enthusiasms and acuity as the work under discussion. Professional critics are crucial to cultural vitality in many ways - as champions of unfamiliar works, as stimulators of curiosity, as goads to clearer, deeper thinking about an artistic experience, to name a few.

Jack,"Students are not in a position to rate professors. Students are in the classroom to learn.

A twenty-year-old who has a whole lot to learn about life should not be able to negatively affect the career of a prof. because he doesn't like that prof or the way he/she runs a class. Try giving out lots of Cs and see how you rate ( a grade, by the way that most students based on my experience deserve). If, as it happens, a particular prof is a terrible teacher, and a few are, word of mouth will determine the degree of success in his/her career.

Jeffrey L. Allen,"Unpaid internships are a bit like a ""friend with benefits"" relationship; a mutually advantageous arrangement with the potential to evolve. While a college upperclassman I cold-called Senators for several sessions in an effort to land an un-assisted (mom & dad didn't make any calls trying to influence anyone) and unpaid internship. Perhaps it is a simple example of ""even a blind hog finds an acorn once in a while"", but the next session I was hired as the Senator's aide when the Sr. aide elected to return to graduate school.

child of babe,"This response reflects my views as well. Polls are a political tool for politicians, not a democratic vehicle where people can voice their opinions and know that it will matter. It is much easier for a pollster to get a higher rate of return with simple questions that require yes/no answers. Thus, should an interviewer encounter someone with a more nuanced view or deeper understanding, those responses are far less likely to be included, let alone even documented.

If people in other countries are able to have cats, indoor and outdoor, without this kind of barbaric practice, there should be no reason for it to be somehow needed n the US. And the idea that allowing declawing decreases the number of homeless cats is laughable, considering the massive problem with stray cats in america, where many european countries where it's illegal have the problem under much better control. And ask any shelter if they never see any declawed cats, and the answer will usually be the opposite. Declawed cats are abandoned regularly because of the behavior problems they develop due to pain and lacking their natural defense.

Peter,"Still fail see how this would have necessarily prevented this horrific event. This would only work if the patient actually tells a mental health professional that he or she wants to harm someone (targeted individuals or in general). There's no evidence that Rodger ever communicated any such feelings to his therapists except a few minutes before he started killing.

MR,At first the need for one person's opinion seemed unnecessary to me when we get so many for no cost but having critics is still very important in our lives; in the lives of the artist. To just the viewer it might not be so important for a professional critique but for the people behind the show it means a lot. Even if the critique isn't the most positive thing the artist still needs someone with experience to call them out on the things they might have not seen for themselves.

conehead,"I think if one had Prince Charles for a son, watched how he treated Diana, and learned of the Camilla as tampon conversation her stepping down would be unworth of her. QEII loves England and while she also loves her son why would she inflict him a people she cares for.

Thus opting out, depriving schools of the funds for your enrollment, and then demanding services from them anyway, is unfair. Why did no debaters bring these up? Am I mistaken?

Rich Carrell,"Take it from a relatively new author, the present system sucks. First of all, it seems that most of the new books are by celebrity authors, many of which are just using their name to sell books and never wrote a word. Secondly, too many authors with great books are out in the cold since they cannot land a big time author. The system does not work very well for the readers. Go into a book store and look at the crap on display. Where do they find these books? With bookstore shelf space at a premium, I welcome anything that allows the little guy a chance. Besides, with e publishing, why do you need book stores? I like the feel of a book in my hands but at 25.00 it is too much. When the published gets 60% or more it makes no sense for anyone.

Sam I Am,"Real-name attribution shouldn't be the rule, at least on this site. As it stands, all NY Times commenters are known by their real names by the NY Times. Since the NY Times can suspend or terminate commenting privileges, this private real-name attribution does 95% of the job in ensuring online civility.

Dave,"I agree with this, and I would add that I think they can even change the results with their questions. Undoubtedly some policers either have polled or will poll the question, ""Do you think Bernie Sanders can win the election?"" A lot of people are more interested in this kind of question than questions of real policy, because it gives them a chance to feel like an expert on the subject of politics. The obvious correct answer is no, so most people will say no. But that question is biassed by existing poll numbers. Nobody knows who can win, but everyone wants to think they know because they like predictability.

KBronson,"All human beings are a potential threat. There are those who are honest about aggressive feelings and thoughts and those who deny and conceal. Imminent threat is a other matter. Tarasoff properly recognizes some responsibility to third parties but offers tremendous leeway to deal with that--reporting to the police is one option and usually the most ineffective and destructive. Involving family and others in the patients supportive social environment usually is far more effective and, even when done dispite objection by the patient, may preserve the therapeutic relationship.

Sierra,"I have worked internationally for 15 years and knowing French, German, and Russian was a life saver. I learned French along with English in school, German came from my in-laws, and Russian was my first language and it came from my grandparents. When I was in college in the 1980s, everyone was required to take at least 1 year of a foreign language. Each major had its own language option(s). And yes, my major's options were French, Russian, and German. I took Russian so I could get better at reading and writing. Languages should start in elementary school, at least the very basics. In middle school, it would be great if students had options of French or German.

swp,"Its not about religion, its about self-destructive behavior and child abuse. We 'believe' that more available birth control and education are at odds with mainstream religion; when actually most of the devote are not fanatics. America is afraid to place restriction on the poor, mentally retarded, mentally ill, felons, or even youth to prevent them from having children or owning guns. To do so places a society at risk of sterilizing the innocent, or worse. I've watched so many members of my family seek religious solutions to medical issues because the medical answers aren't there. They become recluses in homeless shelters. They suffer and their children suffer. Society somehow imagines the answer is making them 'unborn' because real solutions are complex, expensive and require new technologies that aren't here yet. For me the question is, ""How do we help people who are suffering, so they make better choices?"" Good faith, means trusting others to behave altruistically; unless they don't. When they are hurting others the issue is no longer about their rights. Children are not the possession of a cult, community or individual.

MB,"Homeschoolers, by and large, are Christian conservatives who don't want their kids learning about godless things like global warming, evolution, and multiculturalism, and don't want their good kids corrupted by bad kids--in essence, they want to individualize education, and limit social contact with people not of their persuasion. Even if the latter is not a primary motivation, it is incident to the former. Great.

Reader,"This is a ridiculous and absurd bastardization of the idea of 'feminism'. In a feat of intellectual gymnastics, this argument tragically turns feminism on its [covered] head.

Andrew Zuckerman,I'm an attorney and frequently appear in Family Court. The court has substituted audio recording for live reporters in most proceedings. The resultant recordings are then transcribed manually by someone listening to the audio record if transcript is ordered. The transcripts that are typed from the audio recording of the proceeding are invariably terrible. Parts of the transcript are virtually always missed and marked as 'inaudible.' Other parts are garbled. The transcripts are frequently worse than nothing at all.

When you read again and again that the teacher doesn't like taking questions and instead prefers to stick to her outline, that's important information. When you read numerous reviews saying the students came away from the class with a new love of the material, that's important information. It's also really easy to see which professors are well-liked for being easy--which is also important information for a student who either needs a filler class to round out an otherwise brutal semester, or needs stronger instruction in that subject, in which case he can avoid the easy teacher.

The director and his highest assistants should be prepared to resign the moment they are asked to partake of an illegal action, or one unjustified in defense of the country.

oh,"I think the issue that we ought to be able to agree on, is that birth right citizenship has to end. The motivation for immigration can vary, but poverty and lack of opportunity in the country of origin seems like its often a cause. And international policies that worsen prospects for a better life would have to be seen as a contributing factor as well. Yet, openly rewarding illegal immigrants with automatic birthright citizenship is incentivizing the disregard of the host country's own laws. This continuing conversation over immigration going on in the US, mirrors that going on in Europe today. It's the same issue. Do we fix the world first, and hope the desperation driving illegal immigration abates over time? Or absorb those flows of people from those troubled regions seeking a better life now? I think its better, and more fair to all concerned, to have a managed process for documented labor, visitation and immigration, than a mad lawless rush across borders.

John R,"With an increase in insurance mergers, and the most recent Aetna/Anthem failed merger due to the FTC, there has been a substantial decrease in competition within the insurance sector. Lack of competition is bad for consumers because there are less players fighting for your business, so it is easier to raise, and keep prices high. Obamacare has also made it impossible for insurance companies to price policies based on pre-existing conditions, which is forcing actuaries to increase insurance costs across the board. Aetna has lost hundreds of millions of dollars on it's Affordable Care Act arm and is dropping the option in 11 out of the 15 states where it was offered. If insurance companies keep getting strangled by the government, there will be a sharp decrease in the participation rate of the Affordable Care Act and the Gov't may be left on the hook to provide policies (socialism) although I'm not sure what would happen if private participation drops off a cliff.

In the end, it is probably true that the CIA has the interests of the country as their objective. The question is: How do they define those interests?

Dan Green,"The Stanford study revealed many issues. Having read newspaper articles about it ,brought me to the conclusion like many issues we pursue with herd mentality, Organic products may have just been a good marketing scheme. I kind of compare it to Drug manufacture advertising, after FDA approval, as if we all of a sudden we have a simple solution to complex problems. Drugs like organic produce, usually turn out to be questionable. Both cattle and humans are full of Antibiotics, problem is we consume meat from cattle.

Jen in Astoria,"Unpaid internships=unpaid, period. They only benefit rich kiddies whose parents can pay their way, and squeeze out other people. When I was in law school, I was offered an ""unpaid internship"" at a large quasi-governmental agency. The train fare alone out to Virginia each day would have cost me $7.50 each day each way roundtrip, and I wouldn't even get reimbursed for that. When I had to turn them down, I got chided for ""throwing away a great learning opportunity."" Zoom fast forward to the dotcom days, where I had to compete against ""unpaid interns"" (usually heavily tattooed/pierced partners of others in the firms).

P. Andrukat,In previous times the Virginia High School League did not let black high school students play sports. It is interesting that it took 16 years after Brown vs. the Board of Education to integrate schools. Perhaps homeschoolers may be able to overcome the prejudice as well. 24 States currently permit homeschoolers to participate in high school sports.

JaaaaayCeeeee,"I once got a summer job near the House of Seven Gables, in Salem, in the hall of records, deciphering and keying in old deed books, from the 1700's. At the end of the summer, they threw away my work, because no one had the patience to read ancient cursive and copy it, when they realized they could instead just scan. Cursive writing, through most of history, was very far removed from your beautiful, cherished, letters. It was used by underpaid recorders, of other people's transactions. The novelty of the letter 's' written as 'f', etc., wears off quickly. However, Kate Gladstone's arguments for teaching children to read cursive, and to write hybrid, which takes little time, can confer big benefits later in life.

rbirds,"This entire conversation gives me heartburn. I am a college teacher who, yes, has entries on Rate My Professor and who works for a college that overtly cites the website when lauding the success of its best teachers. So I pay attention to the public discussions of student evaluations. The heartburn comes not from fear that my rating index is too low but rather in the assumptions of both sides. The potential for abuse of these ratings is not based on students unqualified to evaluate their teachers (false, anyone can distinguish a poor product from a quality one) but rather on the methodology of Rate My Professor and other similar sites.

W.A. Spitzer,"Let me begin by saying that I grew up in farm country (cash grain - corn/soybeans) and I own farm land and annually receive farm subsidy payments. I would make a few points. First, most of the people who expound about farmers and farming have no idea what they are talking about. Second, I have heard about giant farms who receive huge subsidies all my life, so I presume it must be true, but it simply doesn't exist in the corn/soybean area I am familiar with.

Nora,"Thank you! I could not agree more. I was an avid reader as a child and have grown to be an avid reader as an adult, and I believe that being a good reader is like training for being a good listener and ultimately a good citizen of the world.

In other words, the more students dislike a professor, the better those students do in similar classes down the road. Why? Because those professors challenge students to push past their comfort zones and rigid patterns of thinking.

Having worked in healthcare for 27 years I have no illusions about the harm that a high sodium diet can have on some people.

I think the site is dangerous and invites trolling by students with severe misconceptions, those unhappy about grades, and those with gripes that would be better expressed in a face to face discussion.

ManhattanWilliam,"I think the concept of rating professors online (like just about any other form of public ratings) is ludicrous. To think that students attending a college where they are to be judged by a professor and given a grade for a class should be taken as fair and impartial in rating that professor's performance makes ZERO sense. Even worse, of course, are people who go out to eat and suddenly find themselves qualified to write for Gourmet Magazine. I read these reviews occasionally but NEVER take them seriously. Still, complaining will do nothing to stop this from occurring.

Earthling,"According to the Centers for Disease Control, childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years. The percentage of children aged 6-11 years in the United States who were obese increased from 7% in 1980 to nearly 18% in 2012. Similarly, the percentage of adolescents aged 12-19 years who were obese increased from 5% to nearly 21% over the same period. Now, more than one-third of American children and adolescents are overweight or obese. The obesity epidemic is linked to screen time, to kids sitting on their butts looking at screens all day, to the lack of outdoor activity and exercise.

SouthernView,"Fletcher has got it exactly right. The best solution would be for both Elizabeth and Charles to abdicate and turn the Firm over to William and Kate. But since that will not happen, let's postpone until we're left with no choice the ascension of Charles--and even worse, Camilla. The thought of boring, stuffed-shirt Charles as king for decades is bad enough, but having Camilla shoved front and center would be a nightmare come true, even without the formal title of queen.

After my experience, I have decided I will never be an intern and/or work for free again. A lot of people are fooled into believing that based on their grades and/or standing in school, there is no other way to get your foot in the door. That is not true. As a mediocre student, I was able to find a paid position where I worked, got paid, and just as well received the same educational value I would have received if I was unpaid. In my opinion, interns should receive minimum wage. Granted, they have no experience, minor if not any qualifications, and generally no practical knowledge.

Yoda,"The new Greek govt must do 2 things. One is to negotiate a decrease (or restructuring to longer payment terms) of its debt. That is the immediate problem. The new Govt. may or may not be able to do this. That will depend on how the negotiations go with the creditors. Simultaneously, and very importantly however, Greece must undergo serious economic reforms. For example the creation of a land registry, a stop to political vote buying by politicians, a stop to corruption, the creation of an apolitical statistical service, a non-pollitcal civil servant based on merit instead of cronyism, etc. Does the new Govt show any signs of this (beyond rheteric)?

I've taken online courses and they were not well designed, flexible, or conducive to having a discussion. This holds true for a set of courses I took 5 years ago and for several I've taken in the last year. Having an on line course available in conjunction with a live course would be great.

I know from teaching this subject and conducting research, measurement is a very complex and unforgiving process and is as good ad the instrument and its administration. As much as I believe that good measurement of performance is very valuable to faculty members, I also believe that much of this measurement is done carelessly and unscientifically. Consequently, you are more likely to see extreme results and some that do not make the intended sense at all. One of the best compliments I received from a student was in the form of what he or she must have thought to be highly critical, and I quote: ""The worst teacher I have ever had.

WilliamH,"Odd for me to say this since I am (a) so deeply committed to technology and computers and type super fast (>100wpm), and (b) have really bad handwriting -- but I cannot imagine not writing in cursive. Writing in print is impossible. It is so slow as to be like using a early (not even late) generation dial-up modem.

Emmet Duncan,"In the Canadian legal system - and I suspect the American one is the same - a reasonable apprehension of bias is considered to be as pernicious as an actual bias. Indeed, the test has always been whether a party can establish the former, and not the latter. While few are so naive as to think that justices have no views, it is incomprehensible to me that a justice would enter the fray this way. It is unhelpful generally, and it is detrimental to the Court. It is unhelpful in that I doubt those who lean toward Mr. Trump place much weight on Judge Ginsburg's views to begin with - so she is unlikely to change anyone's mind (especially considering the widely-held anti-elites sentiment that has become so prominent this year). And it is detrimental to a Court that has struggled so much in recent years to combat the view that the Court is every bit as entrenched and political as the rest of the political system is.

Sara,"It's absolutely horrifying how people can defend this. There are no excuses to perform this kind of painful and unnecessary amputation on any cat, ever. If people in other countries are able to have cats, indoor and outdoor, without this kind of barbaric practice, there should be no reason for it to be somehow needed n the US. And the idea that allowing declawing decreases the number of homeless cats is laughable, considering the massive problem with stray cats in america, where many european countries where it's illegal have the problem under much better control. And ask any shelter if they never see any declawed cats, and the answer will usually be the opposite. Declawed cats are abandoned regularly because of the behavior problems they develop due to pain and lacking their natural defense.

Since the NY Times can suspend or terminate commenting privileges, this private real-name attribution does 95% of the job in ensuring online civility. Making everyone go by the real name publicly would enhance online civility but at too high a price. I use a pseudonym not because of fear of attribution by people I know, but because I don't wish to become the target of trolls in the real world. I have a name, a profession, a home and a family that doesn't need trolling by haters who object to my views. Yet I'd still like to participate in the public discussion.

Undoubtedly some policers either have polled or will poll the question, ""Do you think Bernie Sanders can win the election?"" A lot of people are more interested in this kind of question than questions of real policy, because it gives them a chance to feel like an expert on the subject of politics. The obvious correct answer is no, so most people will say no. But that question is biassed by existing poll numbers. Nobody knows who can win, but everyone wants to think they know because they like predictability. Asking the question and publicizing the results plants in the people's minds the idea that a voter's judgement about whether a candidate can win or not is an important factor in voting. It isn't.

Tarasoff properly recognizes some responsibility to third parties but offers tremendous leeway to deal with that--reporting to the police is one option and usually the most ineffective and destructive. Involving family and others in the patients supportive social environment usually is far more effective and, even when done dispite objection by the patient, may preserve the therapeutic relationship. This risk is usually not confined to the moment but is at least in part characteriological and sustained.

Sierra,"I have worked internationally for 15 years and knowing French, German, and Russian was a life saver. I learned French along with English in school, German came from my in-laws, and Russian was my first language and it came from my grandparents. When I was in college in the 1980s, everyone was required to take at least 1 year of a foreign language. Each major had its own language option(s). And yes, my major's options were French, Russian, and German. I took Russian so I could get better at reading and writing. Languages should start in elementary school, at least the very basics. In middle school, it would be great if students had options of French or German.

swp,"Its not about religion, its about self-destructive behavior and child abuse. We 'believe' that more available birth control and education are at odds with mainstream religion; when actually most of the devote are not fanatics. America is afraid to place restriction on the poor, mentally retarded, mentally ill, felons, or even youth to prevent them from having children or owning guns. To do so places a society at risk of sterilizing the innocent, or worse. I've watched so many members of my family seek religious solutions to medical issues because the medical answers aren't there.

Otherwise many will read something with no discussion and think the article is valid, when it's not.

I have often learned things from comment sections that added value or clarified issues that were not address in the article but should have been.

MB,"Homeschoolers, by and large, are Christian conservatives who don't want their kids learning about godless things like global warming, evolution, and multiculturalism, and don't want their good kids corrupted by bad kids--in essence, they want to individualize education, and limit social contact with people not of their persuasion.

John R,"With an increase in insurance mergers, and the most recent Aetna/Anthem failed merger due to the FTC, there has been a substantial decrease in competition within the insurance sector. Lack of competition is bad for consumers because there are less players fighting for your business, so it is easier to raise, and keep prices high. Obamacare has also made it impossible for insurance companies to price policies based on pre-existing conditions, which is forcing actuaries to increase insurance costs across the board. Aetna has lost hundreds of millions of dollars on it's Affordable Care Act arm and is dropping the option in 11 out of the 15 states where it was offered. If insurance companies keep getting strangled by the government, there will be a sharp decrease in the participation rate of the Affordable Care Act and the Gov't may be left on the hook to provide policies (socialism) although I'm not sure what would happen if private participation drops off a cliff.

Dan Green,"The Stanford study revealed many issues. Having read newspaper articles about it ,brought me to the conclusion like many issues we pursue with herd mentality, Organic products may have just been a good marketing scheme. I kind of compare it to Drug manufacture advertising, after FDA approval, as if we all of a sudden we have a simple solution to complex problems. Drugs like organic produce, usually turn out to be questionable. Both cattle and humans are full of Antibiotics, problem is we consume meat from cattle.

Jackie,"My company pays interns $10 an hour, and they often are required to do very menial work. That said, interns who show eagerness and promise may be offered full time positions with the company. For-profit companies should absolutely pay their interns. The small investment is an incredible bargain when you consider it a screening tool for potential employees. Several full-time members of my department started out as interns. I can say from experience that it's a far better screening tool than a job interview, and worth every penny. I think unpaid internships are fine, but in limited circumstances--for example, if the student is still in college and can get academic credit. In this case, though, you'd want to make sure that the student is getting training and is not forced to do menial tasks. I had some internships like this in college and they were very beneficial. I also think that non-profit organizations should be able to offer limited unpaid internships. In all other circumstances, internships should be paid, and interns should at least receive minimum wage.

W.A. Spitzer,"Let me begin by saying that I grew up in farm country (cash grain - corn/soybeans) and I own farm land and annually receive farm subsidy payments. I would make a few points. First, most of the people who expound about farmers and farming have no idea what they are talking about. Second, I have heard about giant farms who receive huge subsidies all my life, so I presume it must be true, but it simply doesn't exist in the corn/soybean area I am familiar with.

Jack Robinson,"Comments are a useful and frequently informative part of online news; they should be encouraged but much more closely monitored. For openers, commenters should be allowed only one comment per article to avoid these ubiquitous back and forth , witless arguments which often clog the comments section. Obscene, vulgar and personal attacks should be edited out, but care must be exercised. Many subjects almost demand strong comments which some may find offensive, but do not really cross the line. Some are clearly at the far left, right, or some other extreme, but often bring out ignored, but important points of view. In addition, many articles and editorials contain claims that are either wrong or at best distorted, despite usually high standards of editorial review. Comments are essential for correcting these problems. Some blogs, like Prof Juan Cole usually contain thoughtful, informed and useful information.

mary,"This is definitely a fluff 'issue', but very entertaining. My hypothesis is that people partner best with someone who's relatively compatible on the maintenance spectrum. As a low-maintenance type of gal, the sort who can get ready for an evening out in under 20 minutes (and that includes the shower), I would not be able to tolerate a guy who had 'manny-pedis' and facials.

Rev. Karen Tudor,"In our community, the most elegant, welcoming and practical buildings are our libraries. In the 9 years I have lived here, two libraries have been built and one redesigned and refurbished. Like the comments about the need for internet access among the poor, libraries ARE so much more. They have become a cultural, community hub for education, community activism, art, music, video and social interaction. One library has attracted the local gardening society to create and maintain a butterfly garden with many native plants that are marked for people to learn about them. Another group has offered to create a meandering walking path around the expanse of the building for reflection and a chance to walk in beauty outdoors. In many ways, I see our libraries becoming a sort of secular ministry -- feeding the souls as well as the minds of people.

Because those professors challenge students to push past their comfort zones and rigid patterns of thinking.

John Gunther,"Separating internships as a special class of poorly paid work seems almost pointless. If MacDonald's can't employ a cashier who's willing to work for less than minimum wage (or for free), why can ABC do it for an intern? The only reason for an exception would be if the intern is there for true training purposes and not for the employer's immediate benefit.

SouthernView,"Fletcher has got it exactly right. The best solution would be for both Elizabeth and Charles to abdicate and turn the Firm over to William and Kate. But since that will not happen, let's postpone until we're left with no choice the ascension of Charles--and even worse, Camilla.

Imagine-year after year of pictures of the two puttering in their garden with their little spades and shooting grouse at Balmoral.

Emanuel Kataev,"I've been an intern at several places and can say that while there are educational elements to them, interns are mostly given grunt work to assist paid employees. After my experience, I have decided I will never be an intern and/or work for free again. A lot of people are fooled into believing that based on their grades and/or standing in school, there is no other way to get your foot in the door. That is not true. As a mediocre student, I was able to find a paid position where I worked, got paid, and just as well received the same educational value I would have received if I was unpaid.

WilliamH,"Odd for me to say this since I am (a) so deeply committed to technology and computers and type super fast (>100wpm), and (b) have really bad handwriting -- but I cannot imagine not writing in cursive. Writing in print is impossible. It is so slow as to be like using a early (not even late) generation dial-up modem. And for me at least, writing does stimulate thinking in a way that nothing else does. I took all my college and law school exams in writing, even though we were allowed to type them.
